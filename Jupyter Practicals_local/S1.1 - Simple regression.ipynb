    "\n",
    "Each Jupyter Notebook is made up of a number of 'cells'. A cell can either be text or Python code. To edit a cell, click on it (double-click in the case of text). Once you've finished editing, hold down the Shift key and press Enter. This will execute the code (if a code cell), or render it nicely (if a text cell). Text cells are rendered using Markdown. This allows you to format text and use LaTeX-style commands to typeset mathematical formulae. Google will help you find more details about Markdown syntax (for example, [this site](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) provides a useful quick reference guide).  To change the type of a cell, select it and then click on Cell > Cell Type in the menu at the top. You can also press Esc (to enter 'Command Mode') and then press M (for Markdown) or Y (for Code).\n",

    "In this practical, we will look at inverse problems that are linear, but under-determined: some model parameters may be unconstrained, and regularisation is required to ensure that a stable solution can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will consider performing X-Ray Tomography (XRT) to image the interior of a structure. We assume that the x-rays travel at the same speed regardless of the medium through which they are passing, and so their paths are straight lines between source and receiver. However, the medium causes the x-rays to attenuate: paths through dense objects (such as bones!) arrive at the receiver with far less energy than they had at the source. Thus, by analysing the attenuation along many different paths, we can build up a picture of the interior of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will assume that the intensity at the receiver, $I_{rec}$, is related to the intensity at the source, $I_{src}$ by $$I_{rec} = I_{src}\\exp\\left\\{-\\int_\\mathrm{path} \\mu(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l}\\right\\}$$ where $\\mu(\\mathbf{x})$ is a position-dependent attenuation coefficient. To obtain a linear inverse problem, we rewrite this as $$-\\log \\frac{I_{rec}}{I_{src}}=\\int_\\mathrm{path} \\mu(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{l}\\,.$$ We know that $$\\int\\left[f(x) + g(x)\\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\int g(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x$$ so we say that integration is a *linear* operation, and hence we can solve the XRT problem with linear inverse theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that the object we are interested in is 2-dimensional, so that $\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\mu(x,y)$. If we discretize this model, with $N_x$ cells in the $x$-direction and $N_y$ cells in the $y$-direction, we can express $\\mu(x,y)$ as an $N_x \\times N_y$ vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$. This is related to the data by\n",
